## **Final Project - Eran Cohen**

### **_This project created to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in Automation Testing._**
***
### _Project Overview_
The project is an example of infrastructure for automation testing of different kinds of applications:
* Web based application
* Mobile application
* Web API
* Electron application
* Desktop application

### _About_
The project demonstates a smart automation infrastructure. 
This project contains bulit in hierarchy order of models.
In this way, the tests can be created in very simple way with a minimum lines of code.
Also the infrastructure allows to work with differend kinds of applications.
**Big advantage of the infrastructure is that it can be easy maintained!**

### **_Infrastructure project includes using of:_**
* Page Object Design Pattern
* Project Layers(Extensions/Work Flows/Test Cases...)
* Support of Different Clients/Browsers
* Failure Mechanism
* Common Functionality
* External Files Support
* Reporting System (including screenshots)
* DB support
* CI support 
* Visual Testing
***
### _List of applications were used in this project:_
* nopcommerce demo store - Web based application
* FinancialCalculators - Mobile application
* Dummy API - Web API
* TODO List - Electron application
* Windows calculator - Desktop application
### _Tools & Frameworks used in the project:_
* TestNG - Testing Framework
* Listeners - interface used to generate logs and customize the TestNG reports
* MySQL Free Online DB - used for login to nopcommerce demo web page
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)- for tests execution
* REST Assured - for API testing
* [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) Reports - as the main reporting system
* [Monte Screen Recorder](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.stephenc.monte/monte-screen-recorder) - for video screen record.
* Maven - used to integrate with Jenkins.
### Tests Execution:
> Each of the applications has a few tests for demonstration purpose.
These tests can be developed in a very simple way, due to the rich infrastructure.

### Installing
* You must have Java on your device.

### _Known Issues:_
Sometimes can be conflicts with some dependencies the applications are using.
Hence, the project is for DEMO purpose only. In production it should be divided into several projects.
